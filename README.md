# Analyzing Covid-19 Deaths in Patients with Different Conditions among Various Counties in the United States of America

As a group project comprising of 2 team memebers, this repository presents the work done by me, moreover there are 2 Jupyter Notebooks uploaded, and it contains analysis performed on Coivd-19 using Pandas dataframes, numpy, regression techniques and No-SQL databases design.

* Since the spread of Covid-19 virus which has impacted the whole world, dislodging some of the world’s biggest economies to the bottom with no exception of the United States of America, the death rates across America spiked at a tremendous rate therefore causing tremendous loss of life. Thus such an impact around the world has been a motivation for the research, so as to evaluate the covid-19 mortality among various counties with patients suffering under various conditions such as some patients have septic, influenza and many other moreover finding the probable cases so as to predict the mortality rates of the region, which can help the counties to take measures to avoid such an outcome.
The study aims to analyze various patients’ under different categories of their respective health status. The research in the topic helped to generalize the data in a more efficient manner so as to analyze the Covid deaths across various counties moreover exploring new insights in the hidden data such as number of probable deaths, new cases, updated probable deaths, identifying different age groups and their corresponding symptoms.
